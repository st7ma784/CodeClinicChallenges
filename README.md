# CodeClinicChallenges
A repo for Code Challenges for the drop in clinic at Lancaster University.


## To Add a Challenge

Challenges are based on research code structures, or teaching skills to experienced coders and are designed to be simple and quick to complete. If you would like to add a challenge, please create a new folder with the challenge name and add a README.md file with the challenge description. 
Provide sample code that runs, but is not the most efficient solution. Feel free to put a time limit and/or bounty on the challenge.


### Example Challenge

```python
# Challenge: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the list
# Time Limit: 5 minutes
# Bounty: 1 point
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
for i in my_list:
    sum += i
print(sum)

```
