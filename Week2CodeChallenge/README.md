# Week 2 Code Challenge

Welcome to the Week 2 Code Challenge! This week, we have an exciting problem for you to solve. Put your coding skills to the test and compete for a chance to win a £10 Amazon voucher!

## Challenge Description
This is some research code designed to profile activity in a video. The code is slow and inefficient. Your task is to optimize the code to run as fast as possible.

You are allowed to use any hardware or software you like to optimize the code. The only requirement is that the code must run on a standard laptop or desktop computer, and ideally make use of a GPU if there is one. 

For this bit of research, we are interested in the number of pixels that change between each frame of a video. The code provided reads in a video file and calculates the number of pixels that change between each frame. However, other metrics for "activity" in the region of interest are also of interest - so machine learning approaches are encouraged.
